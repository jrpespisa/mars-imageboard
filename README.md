#Red Planet

###Description:

  Red Planet is a basic image board where space exploration enthusiasts view
images taken by the three Martian Rovers (Spirit, Curiosity, and Opportunity).
Users can comment on images as well as vote on them. The images were obtained
using the [Mars Rover Photo API](https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api).
